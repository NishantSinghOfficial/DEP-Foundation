    <p>As we know E-learning community is flourishing these days very rapidly. E-learning is such a platform
where you get almost all the courses of the world in one click, at one place for which you do not
even have to go anywhere as in the traditional learning system. Along with that, you cannot find all
the courses at one place in the Traditional Learning System. For each and every different course, you
must go to different places.<br/>
So, most of today's youth like to learn through e-learning but as we have studied from childhood till
today in pen and paper mode with a teacher in front of us having a chalk or duster in his/her hand
we are afraid to trust on this. It is said that without giving a try you cannot judge anyone.<br/>
We have so much confidence in this thing that we trust the teacher standing in front of us, or the
Institute / University we are studying, having a big reputation in the society but not on that tutor
who is teaching online. No doubt that the past record of those institutes are quite good and they
must be having a better technique to teach but a chance must be given to e-learning. We have trust
on those institutes they won’t hire a wrong teacher but this is also true that a single thing cannot
work on everyone.<br/>
Think for a while that what worked for one or two student won’t work for the whole class. If it
happened then all the students should be on the top in every institute. But we all know there is
nothing like this. Every body is unique in its own way. The power of understanding as well as power
of capturing things in mind works differently for student. In classroom type of education you are
forced to learn that thing in that particular time only but here in E- learning it’s completely up to
you. When you feel to do so you can go on.<br/>
You know what learning according to your will is better than learning under pressure. So the final
decision is up to you. After all you are the master of your future. We can only show you the correct
path. You are the only one to decide whether to move or not on it.
Therefore, DEP Foundation is going to build an e-learning-platform where you do not have to face all
these troubles and where you will be able to trust as you do in the traditional system. After all we
are here to make you learn more efficiently than the traditional system.</p>

											<p>Foundation of any educational institution is its teachers. Similarly Dep Foundation also focusses on the quality of its teachers.<br/>
On our platform there will be mainly 2 types of teachers, contract-based and freelance.<br/>

<p>For Contract Based Teachers: - To do the quality tests of teachers, they must have to go through a verification test whose verifier will be the moderator of the platform. When their verification will be tested, they will be given a reputation tag.To make the verification process easier and avoid fraudulent they have to pay fees to apply for verification. When their verification will be completed if they are found correct then their verification fee will be returned to them but if they are found guilty then their fee will not be returned.</p>
<p>There will be no contract of money with them. Whatever the revenue will come from their content 70% of them will be given to them. All types of new contract based content creator will be free for users/student in the beginning until and unless the students start believing in them. During that period, total revenue generated by that course will be paid by foundation.

Contract can be of two types.<br/>
<p>A. Contract Of Time: In this type of contract , they can not leave the platform before a certain threshold. It can be quarterly or annually . They can write a book , create new questions for test , Attain lecture , research , make video  tutorial /lecture , demo class etc according to their respective subjects or intrest . <br/>
<p>B. Contract Of Work: In this type of contract , they can not leave the platform before finishing their project/task. It can be a contract for any special course , test series , video lecture of any subject or chapter , book writing ,article, research .</p>
<p>We can not disclose what kind of special contract conditions foundation will have with them right now.To avoid IDEA's theft, the foundation will disclose it after the platform is released.</p>
<p>For Freelance Based Teachers:-
There will be teachers in this category who want to publish some courses on the platform , they will be linked to another organization.They will need a lot of money in the immediate future, so they will want to publish some courses.They will want to test the platform at the beginning.<br/>
They will not have to go through any verification process.Their course will be immediately published on the platform. As we wont do their quality test so any amount of revenue from their course will be payable after some time.When the user's review and rating will be convinced that it is a quality content and there is no misleading in it.Then 70% of their revenues will be given to them.If there is any type of fraud found in that content then they will not be given any kind of revenues. 90% of that course fee will be refunded to the users. Even some other types of restraints will be imposed on that creators which we will disclose later.</p>
<p>How Rating And Reviews Will Work?<br/>
Users may rate and give their opinion about the content , that how effective is the content. Those content have more votes and have more effective review will be more promoted. Reviews will decide whether content will promoted , demoted or removed. Content creator can also claim that given review by user/users are fake. In that case , an administrator will check whether counter claim by creator is right or wrong. If their counter claim will be right , that user have to pay a certain compensation or will banned . If their counter claim will be false , the content creator has to pay a certain amount of compensation to that user. </p>
 <p>By voting and giving reviews , user will gain xp and reward . weightage of reviews of user having higher xp will be more as well as reward.More votes and more good reviews on the contents of content creator will leads to gain them experience level . A user can easily verify that a higher XP level content creator can have better content.</p>
<p>A user can join a course or subscribe to any content by paying prescribed fee. There will be a test after every course and users will be rewarded on basis of their performance.</p>
<p>We will also keep a separate type of reward program to motivate our users , creators, and administrator. Within 3 categories, some people will be selected from each category in the end of every month. Top student of each course will be selected and they will be given a medal to be on the top and some prize money will also be given that will depend on the weight of that course.</p>
<p>Similarly, the best content creator of that month will be selected. They will be given a medal for being the best and prize money will be distributed to motivate them which will depend upon weight of the respective course.
Similarly the best administrator will be rewarded.</p>
<p>As we are giving 70% revenues to the creators so we have 30% of the total revenues remaining.<br/>
For the time being, the contract based content creator's course will remain free for users. Whatever the revenues would be, the foundation would pay.</p>
 <p>Foundation will pay all the following given below.Whose creator will be contracted with the foundation, either on one time fixed payment or on number of user who uses it, on that basis.
Many courses on the platform will be free for the user.
We will bring some test series. No charge will be taken from the user.
Some classes will be of social awareness as well as technology and blockchain awareness which will be free for the user.
There will be some knowledgeable books or papers that can increase the user's knowledge which will also be free for the users.
There will be a lot of other things which we can not disclose right now.
For all these payments, the Foundation has kept 10% of the total token reserve.
Along with that, the Foundation has kept 5% of the total token reserved for the reward of user's rating and reward .
For administrators and team members, the foundation has kept 10% of total token reserve from which core team members can not use their part before 2023.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the foundation has done distribution of the remaining tokens in this way.<br/>
10% - Content Creator <br/>
5% - Bonus Fund <br/>
5% - Bounties & Voting Reward<br/> 
10% - Project Team<br/>
5% - Partners And Advisors <br/>
40% - Core Phase Of Tokens Sale <br/>
25% - Frozen</p>

<p>The Foundation will use frozen token in such a way.<br/>
2% - Bounty & Overhead <br/>
29% - Gift Code Inventory <br/>
12% - IT Infrastructure <br/>
4% - Legal & Financial Overhead <br/>
	53% - Branding And Marketing.</p>

<h5 >What is decentralized education?</h5>
<p>Decentralized education is defined as the transfer of decision-making to the users. Here creator and learner will have the power to decide their subject of content and charge for the content. Quality of content will be judged by the opinion of learner. Foundation will act as medium and escrow between users, and will provide platform and database for the content.</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .col  -->
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="single-faq">
<h5>What will be the different being decentralized?</h5>
<p>Creator's payment will not be fixed but will be given according to the revenue from their content. Foundation has no right to promote or demonte any user, that will only be based on reviews. Hence there will no chance of monopoly. That's why, rating and review are valuable and has some point, which will be redeemable.</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .col  -->
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="single-faq">
<h5>What will be the benifit of decentralized education?</h5>
